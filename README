   Solaris(TM) 10 OS LDAP Client With Microsoft Active Directory"

** adjoin script automates process of joining Solaris client to a
   AD domain. It automates the following steps:
   1. Auto-detect Active Directory domain controller. 
   2. Creates a machine account (a.k.a. Computer object) for the
      Solaris host in Active Directory and generates a random
      password for this account. 
   3. Configures the Solaris host as a Kerberos client of AD KDC
      by setting up /etc/krb5/krb5.conf on the Solaris host.
   4. Sets up /etc/krb5/krb5.keytab file on the Solaris host using
      the keys generated for the machine account.
   5. If you run this script as "adleave" (symlink) then it
      deletes the machine account and leaves the AD domain.

** Build the ksetpw program if the binaries are not available
   for your platform
% cc -o ksetpw ksetpw.c -lkrb5

** Configure /etc/resolv.conf to point to AD DNS server
% cat /etc/resolv.conf
domain mydomain.com
search mydomain.com otherdomain.com
nameserver 11.22.33.44

** Edit /etc/nsswitch.ldap, which will be copied later by ldapclient to
   overwrite /etc/nsswitch.conf:

   1. Make a backup copy if not yet done (Bash syntax):
% cp -a /etc/nsswitch.ldap{,.orig}

   2. Edit /etc/nsswitch.ldap to use DNS (mdns only if applicable):
hosts:		files dns mdns
ipnodes:	files dns mdns

   3. Continue to edit /etc/nsswitch.ldap, setting "ldap" for the following:
passwd:	files ldap
group:	files ldap

   4. Finally, finish editing /etc/nsswitch.ldap to remove "ldap" from all
      other "database" settings (e.g., from "networks", "protocols", "rpc",
      etc.)

** Restart nscd and dns if resolv.conf or nsswitch.conf were modified
% svcadm restart network/dns/client
% svcadm restart name-service-cache

** In the same directory where you have ksetpw run the adjoin script
      -h to get help
      -n for dry runs
      -f force creation of machine account in AD by deleting existing entry
% ./adjoin -f

** Optional: manually create DNS A and PTR RRs in AD for your client

** Issues:
   1. To use this script with Windows 2008 server, remove "@${realm}" from
      the userPrincipalName otherwise you'll get Authentication error. For
      Windows 2012, however, it will work as it is without revision.
      # diff adjoin.win2k3 adjoin.longhorn  
      765c765
      < userPrincipalName: host/${fqdn}@${realm}
      ---
      > userPrincipalName: host/${fqdn}
